# Artificial Neural Networks trained by a Genetic Algorithm to play... Pong?!
**Date:** 2024-05-28

Last night, I sat up working on my final project for a computational biology course. The project is an attempt to train artificial neural networks to play pong, by letting them compete with each other in a genetic algorithm. The results were surprisingly good, and the project is on GitHub for anyone interested: [https://github.com/tbergkvist/ANN-GA-pong](https://github.com/tbergkvist/ANN-GA-pong)
