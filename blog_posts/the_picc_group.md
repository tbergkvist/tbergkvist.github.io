I am happy to announce that I will, along with 3 fellow students, participate as a finalist in the IEEE AP-S Student Design Contest. We call ourselves the PICC group (Polarization and Impedance Controlled Car) and we will present an educational and fancy way to control an RC car with on-body antennas. We will compete against 5 other universities in Florence, Italy, in July. [https://2024.apsursi.org/sdc.php](https://2024.apsursi.org/sdc.php)
