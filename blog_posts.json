The project is an attempt to train artificial neural networks to play pong, by letting them compete with each other in a genetic algorithm. The results were suprisingly good, and the project is on github for anyone interested. https://github.com/tbergkvist/ANN-GA-pong"

We call ourself the PICC group (Polarization and Impedance Controlled Car) and we will present an educational and fancy way to control a RC car with on-body antennas. We will compete against 5 other universities in Florence, Italy in July. https://2024.apsursi.org/sdc.php"
