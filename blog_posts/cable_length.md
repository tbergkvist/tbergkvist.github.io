Today I wrote my first article on medium. It is about using a NanoVNA (a portable type of Vector Network Analyzer) and Python to measure the length of a cable. It is a fun project with the goal of getting more people to use NanoVNAs and the Python module [pynanovna](https://github.com/PICC-Group/pynanovna).
